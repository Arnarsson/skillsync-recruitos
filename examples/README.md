# AI Software Development House Skill

## Overview
Parallel agent architecture for extreme velocity development. Build MVPs in hours, merge codebases in minutes.

## What's Included
- `SKILL.md` - Main skill with complete AI dev house methodology
- `templates/` - Project state and feature queue templates
- `examples/` - Real-world merge example (Next.js + Vite)

## How to Use

### In Claude Code
1. Upload this skill to your Claude Code session
2. Reference it: "Use ai-dev-house to [task]"

### Example Commands
```bash
# Build from scratch

# Merge apps
"Use ai-dev-house to merge SkillSync + RecruitOS"

# Port features
"Use ai-dev-house to port CalibrationEngine from App A to App B"
```

## Agent Architecture
- 🧠 **CTO Agent** - Orchestration & decisions
- 🔍 **Recon Team** - Fast analysis
- 📐 **Architect** - Tech stack decisions
- ⚛️ **Frontend Squad** - UI/UX development
- ⚙️ **Backend Squad** - APIs & services
- 🗄️ **Data Engineer** - Database & schema
- 🧪 **QA Bot** - Testing & validation

## Timeline Expectations
- Foundation: 15 minutes
- MVP: 2-4 hours
- Full merge: 1-2 hours
- Feature port: 30 minutes

## Tech Stack Defaults
- Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI
- Database: Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Auth: NextAuth.js
- Deployment: Vercel
- AI: Vercel AI SDK + Anthropic

## Philosophy
**Shipping beats planning, but reconnaissance prevents disasters.**

All agents work in parallel. CTO resolves conflicts. Feature flags enable continuous shipping.

## Support
Created for rapid prototyping and intelligent app merging. Works best with Next.js ecosystems but adaptable to any modern stack.
