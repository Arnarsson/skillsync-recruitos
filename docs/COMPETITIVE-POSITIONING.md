# RecruitOS vs Team Tailor — Competitive Positioning

## TL;DR

**Team Tailor = ATS (Application Tracking System)**
**RecruitOS = Intelligence Layer**

We don't replace ATS tools — we make them smarter.

---

## The Problem

HR teams already use Team Tailor, Greenhouse, Lever, etc. When they hear "recruiting software," they think: *"We already have that."*

**Our positioning was wrong.**

---

## What Team Tailor Does

Team Tailor is an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**:
- Job posting & career page builder  
- Application management (inbox for CVs)  
- Interview scheduling  
- Candidate database  
- Compliance & hiring workflows  

**What they DON'T do:**
- Find passive candidates (they wait for applications)  
- Analyze GitHub profiles beyond what's on the CV  
- Provide psychometric insights  
- Track AI referrals (ChatGPT/Claude recommendations)  

---

## What RecruitOS Does

**RecruitOS is a recruitment intelligence platform:**
1. **Proactive sourcing** — Find engineers who aren't applying  
2. **Deep technical profiles** — GitHub analysis, skill graphs, Big Five personality  
3. **AI-powered matching** — Alignment scores based on actual code, not keywords  
4. **Attribution tracking** — See which AI chatbots recommend your company  

**We sit on top of ATS tools:**
```
RecruitOS → (finds + analyzes) → Team Tailor → (manages hiring process)
```

## Messaging Framework

### Wrong (competes with ATS)
❌ "Modern recruiting platform"  
❌ "Manage your hiring pipeline"  
❌ "Post jobs and track applicants"  

### Right (intelligence layer)
✅ "Find the engineers who never apply"  
✅ "GitHub-native talent intelligence"  
✅ "Deep profiling before the first interview"  
✅ "We find them. Your ATS manages them."  

---

## Sales Response to "We use Team Tailor"

**Bad:**  
"We're better than Team Tailor"  

**Good:**  
"Perfect. Team Tailor is great for managing your pipeline. But where do those candidates come from? Most great engineers never apply to jobs — they're passive. RecruitOS finds them, gives you deep technical + psychometric profiles, and you can import the best ones straight into Team Tailor."

---

## Integration Strategy

**Phase 1: Export to ATS**
- Export candidate profiles → CSV/API  
- Recruiters manually import into Team Tailor  

**Phase 2: Native Integrations**
- "Send to Team Tailor" button  
- API sync: RecruitOS candidate → Team Tailor applicant  

**Phase 3: ATS Enrichment**
- Reverse integration: Team Tailor candidates → RecruitOS deep profiles  
- "Enrich this applicant with RecruitOS intelligence"  

---

## Market Position

### We're NOT:
- Applicant Tracking System (Team Tailor, Greenhouse, Lever)  
- Job Board (LinkedIn, Indeed)  
- Generic sourcing tool (hundreds of unqualified leads)  

### We ARE:
- **Talent Intelligence Platform**  
- GitHub-first research layer  
- Quality over quantity (10 perfect matches > 1000 resumes)

## Competitive Matrix

| Feature | Team Tailor | RecruitOS |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Job posting | ✅ | ❌ |
| Application management | ✅ | ❌ |
| Interview scheduling | ✅ | ❌ |
| Career page builder | ✅ | ❌ |
| GitHub profile analysis | ❌ | ✅ |
| Psychometric profiling | ❌ | ✅ |
| Passive candidate sourcing | ❌ | ✅ |
| AI skill matching | ❌ | ✅ |
| Personality insights | ❌ | ✅ |
| Attribution tracking | ❌ | ✅ |

**Better together:** Use both.

## Landing Page Updates

### Current (bad)
"Modern recruiting platform"

### New (good)
"Find Engineers Who Never Apply"

**Subheading:**  
"GitHub-native talent intelligence. Deep profiles, psychometric insights, and AI-powered matching — before they hit your ATS."

**CTA:**  
"Start Free" → "Import to Team Tailor →"

---

## Objection Handling

### "We already have recruiting software"
"Yes, and we make it smarter. We're not replacing your ATS — we feed it better candidates."

### "Why can't Team Tailor do this?"
"They can manage applications. We analyze 50,000 lines of code to find engineers who aren't applying. Different tools, different jobs."

### "How does this fit our workflow?"
"You use RecruitOS to discover and vet candidates. When you find someone great, export them to Team Tailor for interview scheduling and hiring workflow."

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update positioning doc (this)  
2. ⬜ Update landing page hero + messaging  
3. ⬜ Add "Integrates with your ATS" section  
4. ⬜ Build CSV export (Phase 1 integration)  
5. ⬜ Create "vs ATS" comparison page

## Lesson Learned

**HR teams don't want another tool — they want their existing tools to work better.**

Position as **intelligence layer**, not **platform replacement**.
