## 🎯 Part 1: Standalone Personality Profile (2 minutes)

**Opening line:**  
> "Most recruiters waste hours interviewing the wrong people. We solve that with AI-powered personality profiles that tell you WHO someone is, not just WHAT they've built."

### Demo Flow:

**[Show Profile Page - Tab 3]**

1. **Point to the top:** "This is our Virtual Personality Profile — it's a standalone product worth 2,000 DKK."

2. **Scroll through sections:**
   - **GitHub signals**: "We analyze their actual code, contributions, commit patterns"
   - **Psychometric profile**: "AI generates a personality assessment based on working style"
   - **Team fit analysis**: "See how they'd fit your team culture"
   - **Risk assessment**: "Flags attrition risk, communication style, work preferences"

3. **Key value prop:**  
   > "This isn't a resume. It's a psychological profile built from real work. You can share this with hiring managers, sell it to clients, or use it internally. It's 100% standalone."

**Talking points:**
- "Saves 5+ hours of screening per hire"
- "Shareable link — send it to anyone"
- "One profile = 2,000 DKK, no subscription"

## 🔍 Part 2: Simplified Search Workflow (2 minutes)

**Transition line:**  
> "But profiles are just one piece. The full recruiting workflow is now 4 simple phases."

### Demo Flow:

**[Go to Search Page - Tab 2]**

1. **Show Phase Indicator at top:**  
   > "See this? Search → Shortlist → Profile → Outreach. Four clear steps. No confusion."

2. **Phase 1: Search** *(30 seconds)*
   - Point to search bar: "Start with job requirements"
   - Click **Hard Requirements** section: "Set must-haves: location, skills, min years experience"
   - Type example query: `"React TypeScript developers Copenhagen"`
   - Hit search

3. **Phase 2: Shortlist** *(30 seconds)*
   - Show candidate cards: "AI scores every candidate based on your requirements"
   - Point to score badges: "Green = strong match, yellow = moderate, red = weak"
   - Click **Compare** on 2-3 candidates: "Side-by-side comparison"

4. **Phase 3: Profile** *(30 seconds)*
   - Click into a profile: "Deep dive into personality + team fit"
   - *(Already covered in Part 1, just remind:)* "This is where you get the 2K personality profile"

5. **Phase 4: Outreach** *(20 seconds)*
   - *(If time allows, show shortlist page or mention:)*  
   > "Finally, we generate personalized outreach emails. Track responses. Done."

**Key message:**  
> "Everything Christopher and VEO said about UI being too cluttered? Fixed. Each phase shows ONLY what you need."

## 💰 Part 3: Pricing Overview (1 minute)

**[Show Pricing/Intake Page - Tab 4, or just talk through it]**

### Pricing Structure:

**Product A: Virtual Personality Profile**  
- **2,000 DKK per profile**
- Standalone, shareable, resellable
- Low barrier wedge product
- No commitment, pay-per-use

**Product B: Full Suite Recruiting**  
- **5,000 DKK per successful hire**
- Early bird Q1-Q2: **3,500 DKK**
- Volume discount above 10 hires/month
- Includes unlimited searches, profiles, outreach

### Talking Points:

> "Two ways to use RecruitOS:"
> 
> 1. **Just profiles** — Buy personality profiles individually. Great for consultants or one-off hires.
> 2. **Full recruiting** — Flat fee per hire. Everything included. We're offering early bird pricing: 3,500 DKK instead of 5,000 DKK through Q2."

**Value comparison:**  
> "Traditional recruiter fee: 15-20% of annual salary. For a 600K salary, that's 90-120K DKK. We charge 3,500 DKK."

**Close:**  
> "No subscription. No lock-in. Pay only for results."

## ⚠️ Common Objections & Responses

**Q: "How accurate is the AI personality assessment?"**  
A: "Built from real GitHub activity — commit patterns, code reviews, collaboration style. Not a quiz, but behavioral data over months/years."

**Q: "Can I try it before buying?"**  
A: "Yes — free search phase. See candidates, scores, matching. Pay only when you want the full personality profile or hire someone."

**Q: "What if the candidate doesn't have a GitHub profile?"**  
A: "We're adding LinkedIn enrichment soon. For now, best for tech roles. That's 80% of DTU spinouts anyway."

**Q: "How is this different from LinkedIn Recruiter?"**  
A: "LinkedIn shows resumes. We show personality, team fit, and attrition risk. Plus, we're 10x cheaper."
