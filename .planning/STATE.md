## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- E2E over unit tests: Pilot needs end-to-end confidence, unit tests can come later
- LinkedIn optional: Not all candidates have LinkedIn; GitHub must work standalone
- Rich GitHub depth: Repos + commits + PRs + READMEs gives AI real evidence
- Server-side API keys: Security fix required before pilot with real customers

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
