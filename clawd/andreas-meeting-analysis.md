# Andreas Meeting Analysis & RecruiTOS Next Steps

**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Meeting with:** Andreas from Ascent (Business Psychologist)  
**Purpose:** Demo RecruiTOS platform and explore partnership opportunities

---

## Part 1: Honest Assessment

### What Happened
The demo had technical issues:
- Chrome extension didn't work
- LinkedIn capture feature failed
- Multiple flow breakdowns during presentation

### Impact
- **Lost credibility** in front of a psychologist who is already skeptical about tech solutions
- Reinforced the perception that recruitment tech over-promises and under-delivers
- Made the platform look like vaporware

### Silver Lining
**Andreas stayed engaged.** Despite the technical issues, he:
- Continued asking questions
- Showed interest in multiple features
- Discussed specific use cases
- Talked about partnership opportunities

**This means the core value proposition landed.**

---

## Part 2: Critical Rebranding Required

### The Problem
You're calling it "personality profiling" - **STOP IMMEDIATELY.**

### What Andreas Said
- DISC profiles are "not based on anything, never validated"
- Compared personality tests to horoscopes and tarot cards
- Warned about the "map vs territory problem"
- People self-report more positively than reality (green-washing effect)
- GitHub data may not capture full workplace behavior

### What to Do Instead

#### ❌ DON'T SAY:
- "AI personality test"
- "Personality profile"
- "Predicts performance"
- "Replaces interviews"
- "Shows who someone is"

#### ✅ DO SAY:
- "Behavioral profile based on observable GitHub activity"
- "Collaboration patterns from public code contributions"
- "Evidence to inform interview questions"
- "Demonstrated work patterns"
- "Observable metrics: review frequency, collaboration consistency, contribution patterns"

### The Positioning Shift
**From:** "We predict personality from GitHub"  
**To:** "We surface objective behavioral evidence from public code activity to reduce hiring bias and inform structured interviews."

---

## Part 3: Three New Features to Add

Based on what Andreas values in his hiring process:

### Feature 1: Social Media Screening ("Zombie Research")
**What Andreas does manually:**
- Checks Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter for red flags
- Looks for controversial posts, reputation issues
- Especially important for leadership hires
- Clients specifically request this service

**Your automation opportunity:**
- Automated social media screening across platforms
- Flag controversial content, reputation risks
- Timeline of public activity
- Professional vs personal persona analysis
- Compliance-friendly (only public data)

**Business case:** They charge for this service. You can automate it.

### Feature 2: Bias Detection Validator
**The problem Andreas highlighted:**
- Hiring is "notoriously filled with bias"
- Physical appearance, attractiveness heavily influence decisions
- Handshakes and gut feelings weigh more than they statistically should
- Unconscious bias is the biggest enemy of good hiring

**Your solution:**
- Show where subjective vs objective criteria are being used
- Flag when appearance-based or demographic factors might be influencing decisions
- Highlight evidence-based criteria vs gut feelings
- Align with Gartner prediction: 25% of applications will be AI-generated fakes by 2028

**Position as:** The AI fake detector + bias reducer in one

### Feature 3: Evidence-Based Candidate Reports
**How Andreas structures his reports:**
1. Predefined criteria (agreed with hiring manager BEFORE seeing candidates)
2. Systematic scoring on each criterion
3. Burden of proof for each claim
4. Separation of evidence from interpretation
5. Transparent decision-making process

**Your template structure:**

```markdown
## Candidate: [Name]

### Role Requirements (Predefined)
- [ ] React expertise (required)
- [ ] Team collaboration (required)
- [ ] Independent problem-solving (nice-to-have)

### Evidence Collected

#### Technical Skills
**Claim:** Experienced React developer
**Evidence:** 
- 3 public React projects on GitHub
- 1,200+ contributions in past year
- Active in React community discussions
**Confidence:** High

#### Collaboration Patterns
**Claim:** Strong collaborator
**Evidence:**
- 47 pull request reviews in past 6 months
- 23 collaborative projects
- Average response time to code review requests: 4 hours
**Confidence:** Medium-High

#### Red Flags
**None detected** in social media screening
**None detected** in fake profile analysis

### Interview Focus Areas
Based on gaps in evidence:
1. Ask about specific React hooks implementation (verify depth)
2. Explore remote work experience (not visible in GitHub)
3. Discuss conflict resolution (collaboration metrics don't capture this)

### Recommendation
**Proceed to interview** - Strong technical evidence, good collaboration signals, no red flags.
```

## Part 4: Fix Demo Flow Urgently

### The Standard
**Before you send Andreas (or anyone) a demo link:**

Test the complete flow **3 times** from a fresh browser:

#### Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] Chrome extension installs without errors
- [ ] LinkedIn capture works on 3 different profiles
- [ ] GitHub search returns results
- [ ] Profile enrichment completes successfully
- [ ] Behavioral profile displays correctly
- [ ] Export/share functionality works
- [ ] Mobile view doesn't break
- [ ] Test with slow internet connection
- [ ] Clear cache and test again
- [ ] Have a backup demo video ready

#### During Demo Best Practices
1. **Pre-load data** - Don't rely on live capture during demo
2. **Have examples ready** - Show polished, working examples first
3. **Acknowledge limitations** - "This is in beta, focusing on X use case first"
4. **Backup plan** - Screenshots/video if live demo fails
5. **Script the flow** - Don't improvise the demo path

### The Rule
**No excuses. No "it usually works" explanations. No demo until it's bulletproof.**

One failed demo = months of credibility loss.

## Part 5: Positioning Strategy (Use Andreas's Exact Language)

### What Resonates with HR/Psychology Professionals

#### Core Message
"RecruiTOS reduces bias through systematic, evidence-based candidate evaluation."

#### Key Points (in order)

1. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**
   - "We help you define hiring criteria BEFORE seeing candidates"
   - "Every claim needs evidence - burden of proof standard"
   - "Separate objective data from subjective interpretation"

2. **Bias Reduction**
   - "Combat the bias inherent in traditional hiring"
   - "Reduce influence of appearance, gut feelings, handshakes"
   - "Systematic scoring prevents unconscious bias"

3. **Behavioral vs Personality**
   - "Behavioral profiles from observable activity"
   - "Not personality predictions - demonstrated work patterns"
   - "Public contributions show collaboration habits, not character"

4. **Data Sovereignty & Compliance**
   - "EU data sovereign, GDPR compliant"
   - "Only public data, no scraping private profiles"
   - "Ethical AI - transparency in how data is used"

5. **Validation & Credibility**
   - "Designed with input from organizational psychologists"
   - "Follows evidence-based hiring research"
   - "Addresses the challenges psychology professionals see in recruitment"

### The Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)

> "RecruiTOS is an evidence-based hiring platform for technical recruiting. We help you define objective criteria before seeing candidates, then surface behavioral evidence from GitHub and LinkedIn to reduce bias. Instead of personality predictions, we show observable patterns: collaboration frequency, code review habits, contribution consistency. We're EU data sovereign, GDPR compliant, and designed with organizational psychologists. Think of it as systematic candidate evaluation that makes hiring decisions transparent and defensible. Perfect for scaling tech teams where bias is expensive and technical assessment is hard."

## Email Template: Follow-Up to Andreas

**Subject:** RecruiTOS Demo + Podcast Collaboration

**Body:**

```
Hi Andreas,

Great meeting you today. Really appreciated your perspective on hiring bias and the psychology behind candidate evaluation.

You raised critical points about personality vs. behavioral profiling that I'm taking seriously. We're reframing RecruiTOS to focus on observable behavioral patterns from GitHub activity, not personality predictions. Your language resonated: "burden of proof," "evidence-based criteria," "systematic evaluation."

I'm fixing the demo issues we hit (Chrome extension, LinkedIn capture). Once stable, I'd love to send you a working demo and get your professional feedback on the behavioral profiling model.

Three things I'd like to explore:

1. **The 200-employee hiring project** - You mentioned a startup scaling mostly developers starting April/May. RecruiTOS could support that systematically. Happy to discuss timeline, scope, and what that would look like.

2. **Psychology validation** - Would you be interested in an advisory role? We need a psychologist's credibility to avoid the DISC profile trap. Quarterly reviews of our behavioral model, help with positioning, access to your DTU network. Compensated via consulting fee or equity.

3. **Podcast collaboration** - Founder mental health is under-discussed. Your academic background + my founder experience could make for authentic conversations. Men's mental health, ADHD as advantage, burnout culture, parenting + startups. Interested?

Also thinking about your "zombie research" service - social media screening for red flags. That's something RecruiTOS could automate (public data only). Could save your team hours per candidate.

Let me know what resonates. Happy to chat this week.

Best,
Sven

P.S. - Serious about the feedback on personality vs behavioral framing. You're right that we need to be careful not to oversell what GitHub data can show. Want to get this right.

## Key Quotes from Andreas (Use in Marketing)

> "Having a tool to search GitHub systematically would be a huge help. We'd probably need to hire technical recruiters, but this would help us and them a lot."

> "Hiring is notoriously filled with bias. Physical appearance, attractiveness, handshakes - all these things weigh much more than they statistically should in hiring decisions."

> "The problem with personality tests is they're sold as more stable and predictive than they actually are. Better to show observable behavioral data and let people interpret it."

> "We always try to define criteria with the hiring manager BEFORE seeing candidates. That's what reduces bias - knowing what you're looking for before you meet someone."

> "Social media screening is something our clients specifically request. They don't want someone with controversial posts, especially for leadership roles."

## Competition Analysis (Based on Andreas's Mentions)

### What They Use Now
- LinkedIn Recruiter (expensive, manual)
- Manual GitHub searches (time-consuming, unsystematic)
- DISC profiles (he thinks these are bullshit)
- Social media checks (manual "zombie research")
- Traditional recruitment firms (expensive, slow)

### Your Advantages
1. **Systematic GitHub search** - They can't do this now
2. **Evidence-based approach** - Aligns with psychology best practices
3. **Bias reduction** - They care about this
4. **EU data sovereignty** - Compliance matters
5. **Price point** - Cheaper than recruiters, more thorough than manual

### Your Weaknesses (Fix These)
1. **Demo reliability** - MUST work flawlessly
2. **"Personality" language** - Triggers skepticism
3. **No validation studies** - Need psychologist credibility
4. **Early stage bugs** - Perception of vaporware
