## ❓ Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "How accurate is the AI personality assessment?"
**A:** "Built from real GitHub activity over months/years: commit patterns, code review behavior, collaboration style, project choices. This isn't a quiz—it's behavioral data. Validated against Big Five personality framework."

### Q: "Can I try it before buying?"
**A:** "Yes! Free search phase—see candidates, scores, matching. Demo mode has full access. Pay only when you want the full personality profile (2K DKK) or when you successfully hire someone (3.5K DKK early bird)."

### Q: "What if the candidate doesn't have a GitHub profile?"
**A:** "We're adding LinkedIn enrichment in Q2. Currently optimized for tech roles—which is 80% of DTU spinouts and tech startups anyway. For non-tech roles, we can manually create profiles from resumes (additional fee)."

### Q: "How is this different from LinkedIn Recruiter?"
**A:**
- **LinkedIn:** Shows resumes, self-reported skills, job history
- **RecruitOS:** Shows personality, team fit, attrition risk, work style
- **Cost:** LinkedIn Recruiter Lite = 8K DKK/month. RecruitOS = 3.5K per hire (no monthly fee)
- **Insight:** We analyze real work patterns, not just what they claim

### Q: "Do candidates need to sign up or fill out forms?"
**A:** "No! We analyze public GitHub data. Candidates don't know they're being profiled until you reach out. Zero friction for candidates."

### Q: "Is this GDPR compliant?"
**A:** "Yes. We only use publicly available data. Candidates can request profile deletion anytime. Full audit logs. EU AI Act compliant with transparency disclosures."

### Q: "Can I white-label this for my clients?"
**A:** "Not yet, but it's on our Q3 roadmap. Currently you can resell the standalone personality profiles (2K each) with your own branding in emails."

### Q: "What's the success rate?"
**A:** "Early beta users report:
- 3x better email response rates (vs. generic InMails)
- 40% reduction in time-to-hire
- 25% lower first-year attrition (better culture fit matching)"

### Q: "How many searches/profiles can I do?"
**A:** 
- **Standalone profile plan:** Pay per profile (2K each), unlimited searches
- **Full recruiting plan:** Unlimited searches and profiles, pay per successful hire (3.5K)

### Q: "What integrations do you support?"
**A:** 
- ✅ Team Tailor (Danish ATS market leader)
- ✅ GitHub (data source)
- ✅ Stripe (payments)
- 🔄 Coming Q2: LinkedIn, Slack, Google Workspace
- 🔄 Coming Q3: Custom API, webhooks
