## 📊 Key Messages Summary

### Problem Statement
> "Recruiters waste 5+ hours screening the wrong candidates. Resumes don't reveal personality, culture fit, or team dynamics."

### Solution
> "RecruitOS uses AI to analyze real GitHub work patterns and generates psychological personality profiles—before you ever send an email."

### Value Proposition
> "95% cost savings vs. traditional recruiters: 3,500 DKK per hire (early bird) instead of 90-120K DKK."

### Unique Differentiators
1. **Personality-first recruiting** - Not just skills, but team fit and work style
2. **Real behavioral data** - Built from actual GitHub activity, not self-reported
3. **Standalone profiles** - 2,000 DKK product recruiters can resell
4. **Simplified UX** - Clean 4-phase workflow (Search → Shortlist → Profile → Outreach)
5. **Danish market focus** - Team Tailor integration, local compliance

---

## 💰 Pricing (Memorize)

### Standalone Personality Profiles
- **Price:** 2,000 DKK per profile
- **Best for:** Consultants, one-off hires, reselling to clients
- **Includes:** Full AI personality assessment, shareable link, PDF export
- **Commitment:** None - pay per use

### Full Recruiting Suite
- **Regular Price:** 5,000 DKK per successful hire
- **Early Bird (Q1-Q2):** **3,500 DKK per hire** 🎉
- **Best for:** Active recruiting teams, multiple hires
- **Includes:** Unlimited searches, profiles, outreach, pipeline management
- **Commitment:** None - pay only for successful hires

### Cost Comparison
| Provider | Cost per Hire | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Traditional Recruiter** | 90,000 - 120,000 DKK | 15-20% of annual salary |
| **LinkedIn Recruiter Lite** | 8,000 DKK/month | Subscription required |
| **RecruitOS (Early Bird)** | **3,500 DKK** | No subscription, pay per result |

**Savings:** 95% vs. traditional recruiter fees

---

## ❓ Top Questions & Answers

### Q1: "How accurate is the AI personality assessment?"
**Answer:**  
"Built from real GitHub activity over months or years: commit patterns, code review behavior, collaboration style, project choices. This isn't a questionnaire—it's behavioral data. We use the Big Five personality framework, validated by industrial-organizational psychology research."

### Q2: "Can I try it before buying?"
**Answer:**  
"Absolutely! The demo mode gives you full access to all features. Try searches, explore profiles, test the pipeline. You only pay when you order a standalone profile (2K DKK) or successfully hire someone (3.5K DKK early bird)."

### Q3: "What if the candidate doesn't have a GitHub profile?"
**Answer:**  
"Great question. Currently, RecruitOS is optimized for tech roles—developers, engineers, data scientists. That's about 80% of DTU spinout hires anyway. We're adding LinkedIn enrichment in Q2 2026 for non-tech roles. For now, if a candidate lacks a GitHub profile, we can manually create profiles from resumes for an additional fee."

### Q4: "How is this different from LinkedIn Recruiter?"
**Answer:**
| Feature | LinkedIn Recruiter | RecruitOS |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Data Source** | Self-reported resumes | Real GitHub activity |
| **Insights** | Skills, job history | Personality, team fit, work style |
| **Cost** | 8K DKK/month | 3.5K DKK per hire (no subscription) |
| **Focus** | What they claim | Who they actually are |

### Q5: "Do candidates need to sign up or give permission?"
**Answer:**  
"No! We analyze publicly available GitHub data. Candidates don't know they're being profiled until you reach out. Zero friction for candidates. However, we're GDPR compliant—candidates can request profile deletion anytime, and we provide full transparency disclosures per EU AI Act requirements."

### Q6: "Is this GDPR and EU AI Act compliant?"
**Answer:**  
"Yes, fully compliant. We only use publicly available data, maintain immutable audit logs, provide transparency disclosures, and honor deletion requests. Our legal docs are in `/docs/EU_AI_ACT_COMPLIANCE.md` if you'd like details."

### Q7: "Can I white-label this for my clients?"
**Answer:**  
"Not yet, but it's on our Q3 2026 roadmap. Currently, you can resell the standalone personality profiles (2K DKK each) and customize the email branding when you send them to clients."

### Q8: "What's the success rate or ROI?"
**Answer:**  
"Early beta users report:
- **3x better email response rates** (vs. generic LinkedIn InMails)
- **40% reduction in time-to-hire** (less back-and-forth screening)
- **25% lower first-year attrition** (better culture fit matching)
- **5+ hours saved per hire** in screening time"

### Q9: "How many searches can I do? Are there limits?"
**Answer:**
- **Standalone profile plan:** Unlimited searches, pay per profile ordered (2K DKK)
- **Full recruiting plan:** Unlimited searches and profiles, pay per successful hire (3.5K DKK)
- **Demo mode:** Unlimited everything for testing (no commitment)"

### Q10: "What integrations do you support?"
**Answer:**
| Integration | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Team Tailor** | ✅ Live | Two-way sync, Danish ATS leader |
| **GitHub** | ✅ Live | Data source for analysis |
| **Stripe** | ✅ Live | Secure payments |
| **LinkedIn** | 🔄 Q2 2026 | Profile enrichment |
| **Slack** | 🔄 Q2 2026 | Team notifications |
| **Google Workspace** | 🔄 Q2 2026 | Calendar, Gmail |
| **Custom API** | 🔄 Q3 2026 | Webhooks, white-label |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Demo Link Not Working
**Symptoms:** 404 error, Vercel not found, blank page

1. Try alternative URL: `https://recruit20-git-master-arnarssons-projects.vercel.app?demo=true`
2. Check Vercel deployment status: `vercel ls --prod`

4. Use localhost for local demo: `npm run dev` then `http://localhost:3000?demo=true`

### Demo Mode Not Activating
**Symptoms:** Login prompt appears, payment gates shown, no sample data

**Solutions:**
1. Verify URL includes `?demo=true` parameter
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to manually enable admin mode
3. Open browser console (F12) and run:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('recruitos_demo_mode', 'true');
   localStorage.setItem('recruitos_admin_mode', 'true');
   location.reload();
   ```
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode
5. Clear browser cache and cookies

### Screen Recording Issues

**Solutions:**
- **Echo:** Record in smaller room, use directional microphone
